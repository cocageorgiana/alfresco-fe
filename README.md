The project for FE side is done in Angular 8, I did the implementation using Typescript. 
I used WEBSTORM IDE. 
In order to run the application, first of all run "npm i" for install the dependencies. 
After that, the application to be up and running use the command "ng s" 
For running the tests use the command "ng test --code-coverage"
